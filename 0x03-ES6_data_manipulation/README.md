## This project covers some basics of ES6 data manipulation including: How to use map, filter and reduce on arrays, Typed arrays, The Set, Map, and Weak link data structures

# TASKS

### [0.Basic list of objects](./0-get_list_students.js)
- Write a function named getListStudents that returns an array of objects.

### [1.More mapping](./1-get_list_student_ids.js)
- Write a function named getListStudentIds that returns an array of ids from a list of object.

### [2.Filter](./2-get_student_by_location.js)
- Write a function named updateStudentByLocation that returns an array of students for a specific location.
- It should accept a list of students (from `getListStudents`) and a `city` (string) as parameters.
- You must use the filter function on the array.

### [3.Reduce](./3-get_ids_sum.js)
- Write a function named getStudentIdsSum that returns the sum of all the student ids.
- You must use a reduce function on the array of students.

### [4.Combine](./4-update_grade_by_city.js)
- Write a function named `updateStudentGradeByCity` that returns an array of students for a specific city with their new grade
- It should accept a list of students (from `getListStudents`), a `city` (string), and `newGrades` (array of grades) as parameters
- You must use `filter` and `map` combined.

### [5.Typed Arrays](./5-typed_arrays.js)
- Write a function named `createInt8TypedArray` that returns a new `ArrayBuffer` with a `Int8` value at a specific position.
- It should accept a `length` (number), `position` (number) and `value` (Number) as parameters.
- If adding the value is not possible the error `Position outside range` should be thrown.


### [6.Set data structure](./6-set.js)
- Write a function named `setFromArray` that returns a set from an array.
- It should accept an (Array, of any kind of element).
